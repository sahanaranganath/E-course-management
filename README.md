It is undeniable that online education provides ample of benefits to young learners. As a result a 
lot of E-course platforms have started which provides a platform where users can take up courses 
of interest and develop skills. This project is mainly concerned with developing a database which 
helps in the management and maintenance of such platforms. It allows a user to pick a topic of 
interest and study it. It enables learning new skills. The user can visit the site and register with the 
required information that is expected by the system. Once registered the users can view all the 
courses that is available and purchase the courses that interests them. By designing a database it 
will be easy for the users (who are interested in taking up courses) and the manager to keep a track 
of user registrations, courses allotted and transactions. Therefore, E-course database holds all the 
required data in the place so that it is accessible by the users and the admin. 
The internal database will be developed using MySQL. The frontend is dominated using PhP. The 
user level accessibility has been restricted into two zones the administrative and the normal user 
zone.
TITLE: E-Course Management System
INTRODUCTION: 
The concept of traditional education has changed radically within the last couple of years. The 
period of the covid pandemic has increased the interests of online courses drastically. An E-course

working, in-between jobs, and even while raising their families. Earning a degree while juggling

that offer such online course. It mainly takes case of the E-course management at the core of the 
database. The system provides information regarding the different courses that are available and 
their status specific to availability. The users can visit the site and register themselves with required 
information that is expected by the system. Each registered user can raise a request to the purchase 
of these courses.
OBJECTIVES:
The main aim of this project is to develop a Database management system for creating and 
managing a Database for a platform that offers E-courses. It should provide a systematic way to 
create, retrieve, upload and manage data. The user (student) should be able to register on the 
platform, view all the available courses and purchase the courses they are interested in. The admin 
shall be able to view all the students who have registered as well as the course details they have 
registered for along with their payment transactions. The admin should also be able to add new 
courses to the platform or edit/delete the existing courses that are available. The overall objective 
is to create a stable and secure database for managing activities on platforms that offers e-courses 
for users
